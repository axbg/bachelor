### The codebase represents the implementation of my bachelor thesis: [*"Designing a Students Admission Information System"*](https://github.com/axbg/flow/blob/master/thesis.pdf)* - the **flow** app.
### The admission model referred throughout the paper is based on the model used at [CSIE](http://csie.ase.ro) in 2019.
### The tech stack is based on Node.js (Koa/Express), React, MySQL, Redis and Docker.
